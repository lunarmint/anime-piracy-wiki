## Is torrenting illegal?

Torrenting itself isn't illegal. However, sharing and downloading copyrighted material may be illegal depending on your local laws.

## What torrent clients are recommended?

**PC:**

- [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download.php) - Powerful built-in search feature that can be expanded through plugins and [Jackett](https://github.com/Jackett/Jackett).

- [rTorrent](https://github.com/rakshasa/rtorrent) - Command line torrent client for linux, can be used with [ruTorrent](https://github.com/Novik/ruTorrent) or [Flood](https://github.com/Flood-UI/flood).

- [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/about/)

- [Deluge](https://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download)

Note: uTorrent has a lot of ads and a poor track record among the torrent community for being nefarious by bundling the app with malware/spyware. It is not trustworthy and Bittorrent (the torrent client) is also owned by the same company.

**Android:**

- [LibreTorrent](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.proninyaroslav.libretorrent)

- [Flud](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.delphicoder.flud)
