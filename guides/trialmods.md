## Staff tiers in r/AnimePiracy

In r/AnimePiracy, we have 3 tiers of staff. They are:
<br>

* Trial Staff:- New staff that are learning the ropes when it comes to moderation.
* Full Staff:- Staff that have "passed" their trial successfully. (If you have any queries, feel free to ask these people, they're super nice!)
* Administrators:- Overseers of the moderation team. They are the ones who recruit trials, approve important changes, and administrate the discord server and the subreddit.
